The concept of Project 2 code is to automatically download any youtube
video into any file location the users wants.

Line 1: I first had to download pip and then "from pytube import
YouTube".

Line 4: This step determines the desired path for download

Line 7: I then call upon the user for their desired video link they want
downloaded.

Line 11:After the link is acquired, it is reasserted into a variable
called "youtube\_video\_url"

Line(s) 14 & 16:I then claify that this link requires the YOUTUBE module
along with adding filter options (The “progressive” option contains the
file having both audio and video).

Line 20: This is displayed when the video has properly been downloaded,
it won't show if there is an error.

Line(s) 21 & 22: This tells the code with no exceptions, if any
exceptions are noticed then the code will not complete.
