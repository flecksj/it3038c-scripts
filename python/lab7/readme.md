I firstly used pycharm in order to easily add the proper extensions I
needed, it is just a better formatted python with more options and error
correctrions. Then I downnloaded the pip extension along with the pillow
extension by clicking settings under your Python project and click on
your project, then click the + symbol in the bottom left in otder to
search for pip and pillow. To install Pillow with regular Python, input
these commands as follows: python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip python3
-m pip install --upgrade Pillow
