Hello. My name is Sam and I created a GPA calculator because I had needed a more efficient way to test different gpa outcomes. The file is fairly self explanatory and very simple to open. No libraries and/or extra extensions will be necessary to run properly. All you need to do is open the file directly from python or automatically. Then follow the prompt and it will run successfully.
